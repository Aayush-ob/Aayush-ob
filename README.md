## About Me

I'm a final year **Biotechnology** student passionate about computational drug discovery. I recently published research in **Elsevier's In Silico** journal and I'm now building cloud infrastructure skills on **GCP + AWS**.

My primary goal is to advance my career in **Cloud Engineering**. I remain deeply interested in **Bioinformatics, Tech, and Science**, leveraging this multidisciplinary background to solve complex problems.
